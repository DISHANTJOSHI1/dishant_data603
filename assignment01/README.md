### Big Data with example and types
_Big Data is a collection of huge data coming from variety of online or offline sources in digital form growing exponentially. Types of Big Datas are as follows:_
- **Structured Big Data:** Data which can be stored, accessed or processed in a fixed format is a type of structured big data. For e.g., table containing strings, int or any character like a worksheet. 
- **Unstructured Big Data:** Data with unknown structure or format in unstructure big data. Image file, videos, audio, etc.
- **Semi-Structured Big Data:** This type of big data contains both the forms of the other forms of big data which visually looks like a structured but is actually unstrucutre. e.g., xml file.



###  6 ‘V’s of Big Data (define each)

_The six 'v's are as follows_
 1. Volume: Big data is a form of data whose volume is so large that it would not ﬁt on a single machine therefore specialized tools and frameworks are required to store process and analyze such data.
 2. Velocity: Velocity of data refers to how fast the data is being generated. Data generated by certain sources can arrive at very high velocities, for example, social media data or sensor data.
 3. Variety: Variety refers to the forms of the data. Big data comes in different forms such as structured, unstructured or semi-structured, including text data, image, audio, video and sensor data.
 4. Variability: Inconsistency of the data set can hamper processes to handle and manage it. For instance, sensor data quality might be inconstant
 5. Veracity: Veracity refers to quality and how accurate is the data. To extract value from the data, the data needs to be cleaned with noise data removed. 
 6. Value: Value of data refers to the usefulness of data for the intended purpose. The end goal of any big data analytics system is to extract value from the data.
