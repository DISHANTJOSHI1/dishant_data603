# Analysis of Twitter Sentiments Using Spark Streaming

## We must speak with the other humans we share this planet with in order to survive. Languages were created for this reason, allowing us to quickly communicate information, send messages, as well as express our feelings through language. Numerous social networks have emerged as a result of digitization. In order to better understand their clients, businesses are using the internet and other social networks to collect information from users about a certain good, service, or topic.

&nbsp;  

## We have Twitter, for instance, a social network where users tweet their opinions every second from all over the world. Additionally, it contains a useful vault of knowledge. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinions mining, is the process of interpreting and extracting feelings from data based on the requirements of a particular research project. AI can assist us in analyzing public sentiment and gathering illuminating context-specific data.
